# Copy Line By Line

A cheeky little html page that can be used to easily copy individual lines of a file to the clipboard

# Use
Simply open the [index.html](index.html) file in your browser to get started. When first loading the app you will be greeted with some help text that will explain how to use the program

Internet connectivity is required to download styling, but all functionality is performed locally

# Development
For maximum portability and simplicity everything is just in a single file, [index.html](index.html). This is meant to be an extremely simple webapp, and should fit comfortably in the single file. It's just good old HTML + CSS + JS
